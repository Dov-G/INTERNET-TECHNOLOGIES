response tests:

1.  writeHead() without headers as parameter only statues and message check that received date header as well as correct status.
2.  writeHead() with headers parameter check received content type and date header.
3.  setHeader() prior to writeHead().
4.  setTimeOut() of response works.
5.  removeHeader only removes wanted header.
6.  write() without calling first write head, check that all headers are written before body.
7.  write() after calling writeHead. 
8.  end() check that is sends all the data and emits 'close' event
9.  set() check that works with multiple calls and overrides.
10. set() with object as a parameter.
11. status() called with a number check that response sent with the matching reason
12. status() check chaining commands works
13. send() tested without parameters
14. send() tested with a single parameter (int)
15. send() tested with a single parameter (string)
16. send() tested with a single parameter (Json)
17. send() with two parameters number and string
18. cookie() with name value and object as parameters
19. cookie() witting cookie twice and check for default path
20. test that different responses are independent of each other

miniHttp and miniExpress tests:

1.  test use of use(root, static(...)) when receiving a good request
2.  use() with non-existing resource, check returns 404
3.  use() trying to access files outside of root folder, check returns 401
4.  test that get() works and request contains correct method, protocol and path. test includes multiple requests 
5.  test post(). request has extended path
6.  test delete() also check that does not respond to wrong method of request,check variable url in root and two messages on single socket (also single chunk)
7.  test put()
8.  test receiving a request with a bad method, result '405 Method Not Allowed'
9.  miniExpress receive a single request in chunks
10. have miniExpress listen multiple times in different fashions and get requests on multiple sockets.
11. tests the next()- has three listeners that the second does not call next check only the first two run
12. miniExpress app works when used and defined in the alternative form
13. test cookieParser() and the use without a given root
14. have miniExpress receive a illegal request check that received 400 and server still running.
15. check app.route
16. test bodyParser ( which calls to test urlencoded) with multi variables spaces and arrays, also tests multiple params in request.
17. test miniExpress request param() function returns parameters, body and query. 
18. test running multiple servers.
19. test server default and regular timeOut works default 2 minutes as written in API.

Note: many things are/where tested through running a simple server and sending requests through the browser,
	or running the list program given (list works without any changes other then require miniExpress).
	Other things are tested automatically when other things work such as 'request' event, if event isn't
	emitted the miniExpress wouldn't handle the request.
